# deca-reader
Application to read the Decawave PC application log file and pull out the distances

This application is a rough bit of work to capture the distace reads from Decawave anchors through the log files.
It will then write the reads out to a given database
Probably not very realible but will do the job till I figure out how to access the sensors directly
